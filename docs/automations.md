# APEX Automations

Automations are a sequential set of actions triggered by query results that monitor data and then perform the appropriate action. Common automation use cases include approving specific requests and sending email alerts.

An automation executes as a query or a PL/SQL function based on a defined schedule. Automations support Data Sources, so the query can execute on a local database, a REST-Enabled SQL service or a REST Data Source.
