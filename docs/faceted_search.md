# Oracle APEX Faceted Search

Faceted search is seen often on the internet typically on shops or sales websites. 

The end user can set filters using facets on the left or upper side of the screen. A facet shows possible values together with the occurrence conflicting the results set. After the end user changes a facet, the results, the dependent facets, and occurrence counts refresh immediately. A Faceted Search page features a faceted search region on the left and a report on the right, which can display as a classic report or a cards support.

When creating a new facet, you can create the following types: 

- Checkbox Group
- Radio Group
- Input Field
- Search field
- Select List
- Range

## Facet Groups

Data models having multiple flag columns can result in a busy faceted search UI. Flag columns typically display two values such as Yes or No (for example, In Stock, Orderable, and so on). To streamline your faceted search UI, you can create a facet group which displays one facet that contains multiple checkboxes.
