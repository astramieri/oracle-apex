# APEX Page Enhancing

The APEX engine primarily relies on two processes to do its job:
- Show Page process, also known as **Page Rendering**
- Accept Page process, also known as **Page Processing**.

## Page Computations

A Page Computation is a logic that can be used to assign values to a single item. 

There are two types of computations:
- **application-level** computations, which are defined at the application level
- **page-level** computations, which are defined at the page level

## Page Processes

A Page Process performs an action at a specified point during the rendering or submission of the page.

## Page Validations

A Page Validation performs a validation on data submitted by the user.
