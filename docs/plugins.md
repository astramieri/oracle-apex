# APEX Plugins

Plug-ins enable developers to create highly customized components to enhance the functionality, appearance, and user-friendliness of their applications.

Plug-ins offer a means of augmenting built-in types by declaratively creating and using new types in your application. Because plug-ins are designed for reuse, developers can export and import them to other workspaces and also share them with the Oracle APEX plug-in community by using the plug-in repository.

The plug-in repository provides a central location where developers can share and download plug-ins. The repository is located on the Oracle Technology Network.
