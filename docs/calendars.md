# APEX Calendars

Oracle APEX has a built-in calendar region type using which you can display calendar events in your APEX applications. App-builder includes a built-in wizard for generating a calendar with monthly, weekly, daily, and list views.

The calendar region in APEX also supports moving or changing calendar events with drag and drop.
