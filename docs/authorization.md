# Authorization

Authorization refers to restricting access to specific pages and components based on user privileges.

In APEX, you can use authorization schemes to implement authorization in an application. 

You can apply an authorization scheme for:

- an entire application
- a page
- specific components (regions, items, buttons)

 APEX allows you to implement authorization schemes in two different ways:

 1. by navigating to Shared Components
 2. by using the Access Control Page.
