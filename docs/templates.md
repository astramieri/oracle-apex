# APEX Templates

An APEX application typically consists of number of pages. A page, in turn, has a number of components like regions, page items, and buttons. **Templates** help you define how these page controls and page components appear in your application.

For example, a page can have different layouts, which can have a left side column layout, right side column layout, or both side column layout. These layouts can be defined as a template. And when you create a page, you get an option to select desired template for a given page.

Templates are categorized by **types**. All the page templates are classified under type page. 

## Template Options

Template options are a way to provide your developers different styling options in the templates or their components.
