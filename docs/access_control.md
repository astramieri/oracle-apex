# Application Access Control

Through the **Access Control List**, you can control access to an application, individual page, or page components. 

When you run the access control wizard, it creates multiple administration pages and the following components. It adds an access control region to the Administration page. You can either specify an existing page as the administration page or a new page can be created.

It also creates various roles like:

- **administrator**, which correlates with the administration privilege
- **contributor**, which correlates with the added privilege
- **reader**, which correlates with the view privilege. 

It also creates various authorization schemes, such as:

- administration rights
- contribution rights
- reader rights

We can use the access control list to associate the access rules with application users.
