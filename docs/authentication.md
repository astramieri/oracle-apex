# Authentication

Authentication is the process of establishing each user's identity before they can access your application. 

It may require a user to enter a username and password or it could involve the use of digital certificates or a secure key.

If all the users have the same rights and privileges, they are referred to as **public users**.

In APEX you can choose from the following authentication methods:
- built-in preconfigured authentication scheme
- creating a custom authentication scheme (you must implement a PL/SQL function)
- choosing to not require authentication
