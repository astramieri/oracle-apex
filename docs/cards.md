# APEX Cards

A cards page features colorful blocks which resemble index cards laid out on a page.

Each card can display a variety of information pulled from columns in the underlying table. A cards report region declaratively supports customizations of layout and appearance and the inclusion of icons, badges, media, and actions.

A cards page functions as a colorful way to display a subset of information and then enable the user to link to more detail. To create a link from a cards page, you create an action and then select an action type. You can create an action to link from a full card, a title, a subtitle, media, or a button.

Layout options include: 
- Grid
- Float
- Horizontal (Row)
