# APEX 23.2 new features

## Working copies

You can make a working copy of an app to fix a bug or add a feature, then selectively merge your changes back into the main application.

## Workflow Designer

You define business process automations visually with a native workflow designer and run them on the built-in engine. Workflow administrators monitor and manage workflow instances in a workflow console.

## Combo Box Item Type

The combo box is a list-based item just like select list, text field with autocomplete, and the pop-up LOV (list-of-values) items. The combo box item type can support selecting more than one value if multiple values attribute is checked.

## Image Upload Item Type

The new Image Upload item type shares similar functionality with the File Browser item, but includes additional capabilities specifically designed for image uploads (e.g. resize, crop, etc.).

## Custom Map Background

You can use custom map backgrounds on the map region, the display map item, and the geocoded item. 

## Faceted-Search Enhancements

The user can choose the operator to filter in the input type facet by tweaking a button in the page designer. This enhancement applies to Smart Filters as well.

## Approval Enhancements

Developers can specify task definition parameters to be updatable. This enhancement will allow workflow administrators or task owners only to update and override the task parameter values.

## Quick SQL Enhancements

Quick SQL has always been the fastest way to create a data model for your APEX application. You type the shorthand syntax for the tables, columns, and constraints you need and it produces a SQL script following best practices that creates them. In 23.2, Quick SQL is now lightning fast. As soon as you pause your typing, it immediately updates the script to reflect your changes.
