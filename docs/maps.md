# APEX Maps

Oracle APEX has a region type called Maps using which you can visualize location data, real coordinates which are available in the database table in your APEX application. 

Using Maps region, the developer can show a world map on a page and can add one or more layers or data points on top of this map. These data points can be coming from a table in your database or through a SQL query, using which you can show features on this map. The background map is a static map, and it is coming from the **Oracle Elocation Services**. And these background maps are ready to use and do not require any API keys.
